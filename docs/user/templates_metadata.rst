Templates and Meta Data
=======================

Two features that are related to the creation, editing and saving of an
item are templates and meta data.

Templates
=========

Templates make it easier for users to add new items that repeat a
heading structure or phrases that are similar to many other items.
Instead of starting from scratch or using a copy, paste, delete, type
new data; templates can be created that have the common
text and structure already completed. A template page must have a
tag of "template".

When creating a new item, users can save time and possibly eliminate
errors by choosing a template from a list of applicable templates.
Only templates having the same content type and namespace as the new item
will be shown as choices.

For templates with the MoinWiki markup, Predefined Variables can be used to insert
date, time, creator, pagename, and the like.

Meta Data
=========

When editing an item (including non-text items like images, etc.),
most themes provide a means of updating certain meta data
associated with the item. The meta fields that may be updated include ACL,
Summary, Tags, Names, and perhaps others.

For fields that may have multiple entries like the Tags and Names fields,
use commas to separate the entries. Leading and trailing spaces are stripped,
embedded spaces become part of the tag or name entry.

Most themes will display the Summary field at the top of the item display.

The format of ACL rules is discussed within the configuration section under
authorization.
